## Script: `create-ssh-jails.md`

This script will create `fail2ban` jails for the following scenarios:

1. **sshd-ddos:** Protects against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks targeting SSH.
1. **sshd-iptables:** Bans IP addresses that trigger too many SSH authentication failures.
1. **sshd-root:** Bans IP addresses that attempt to log in as the root user.
1. **sshd-invaliduser:** Bans IP addresses attempting to log in with invalid usernames.
1. **sshd-repeated:** Bans IP addresses that repeatedly fail SSH authentication within a specific time period.
1. **sshd-gssapi:** Monitors GSSAPI-based authentication failures.
1. **sshd-ssl:** Monitors failed SSH connections using SSL/TLS.
